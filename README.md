# Requirement Analysis in Software Development 

## Introduction 
This repository is created as part of a structured project to understand and document **Requirement Analysis** in software development. The goal is to providestructured explanations, examples, and best practices to understand how requirements are identified, documented, and managed in *Software Development Lifecycle (SLDC)

The purpose of this repository is to :
- Provide a clear overview of requirement analysis and its importance in software engineering.
- Document different steps, examples, and use cases of requirement gathering.
- Serve as a practical guide for beginners and professionals to learn requirement documentation through real world examples.

## Repository STRUCTURE 
- **/docs** → Contains requirement analysis documents, templates, and detailed explanations.
- **/examples** → contains practical case studies and requirement analysis samples.
- **/diagrams** → Holds use case diagrams, flowcharts, and system design visualisations.
- **README.md** → Overview and purpose of the repository

## What is Requirement Analysis?
**Requirement Analysis** is the process of gathering, understanding, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is one of the most critical phases of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)** because it lays the foundation for all other stages of development, such as design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. 

During requirement analysis, software engineers and business analysts work closely with stakeholders (clients, users, project managers, and domain experts) to clearly define:
- **What the system should do** (functional requirements).
- **How the system should perform** (non-functional requirements)
- **Constraints and assumptions** the system must adhere to.


### Importance of Requirement Analysis 
1. **Prevents misunderstandings** - ensures that developers and stakeholders share a common understanding of project goals. 
2. **Saves cost and time** - identifying errors or ambuiguities early in project avoids expensive rework later.
3. **Provides a foundation for design and development** - accurate requirements make it easier to design and build the right product.
4. **Ensures user satisfisfaction** - aligning the software product with user needs increases the chance of project success. 
5. **Facilitates project planning** - helps estimate effort, budget, and resourses required. 

### Key Activities in Requirement Analysis 
- **Elicitation** : Gathering requirements through interview, surveys, observations, etc.
- **Analysis** : Clarifying and prioritising requirements, resolving conflicts.
- **Specification** : Documenting requirements clearly in Software Requirement Specification (SRS).
- **Validation** : Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to ensure correctness. 
- **Management** : Handling changes in requirements througout the project lifecycle.

## Why Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
It ensures that developers, stakeholders, and clients have a shared understanding of the system being built.

key benefits include:
1 **Clarity** - Define what the system should do.
**Accuracy** - Reduces misunderstandings between developers and clients.
**Planning** - Provides a foundation for system design, development, and testing.
**Risk Reduction** - Identifie constraints, risks, and dependencies early .
