# Requirement Analysis in Software Development 

## Introduction 
This repository is created as part of a structured project to understand and document **Requirement Analysis** in software development

The purpose of this repository is to :
- Provide a clear overview of requirement analysis and its importance in software engineering.
- Document different steps, examples, and use cases of requirement gathering.
- Serve as a practical guide for beginners and professionals to learn requirement documentation through real world examples.

## Repository STRUCTURE 
- **/docs** → Contains requirement analysis documents, templates, and detailed explanations.
- **/examples** → contains practical case studies and requirement analysis samples.
- **/diagrams** → Holds use case diagrams, flowcharts, and system design visualisations.
- **README.md** → Overview and purpose of the repository

## Why Requirement Analysis?
Requirement analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
It ensures that developers, stakeholders, and clients have a shared understanding of the system being built.

key benefits include:
1 **Clarity** - Define what the system should do.
**Accuracy** - Reduces misunderstandings between developers and clients.
**Planning** - Provides a foundation for system design, development, and testing.
**Risk Reduction** - Identifie constraints, risks, and dependencies early .
